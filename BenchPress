    <h1>How to Bench Press</h1>
    <p>The bench press is a popular exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Here's how to perform a bench press:</p>
    
    <h2>Step 1: Set up the bench and barbell</h2>
    <p>Begin by selecting the appropriate weight for your fitness level. Then, position the bench so that the barbell is directly above your chest when you lie down on it. Make sure the barbell is securely fastened and that the weight plates are evenly distributed.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 2: Get into position</h2>

    <h2>Step 3: Lower the barbell</h2>
    <p>Inhale deeply and slowly lower the barbell towards your chest, keeping your elbows close to your sides. Lower the barbell until it touches your chest, but be sure not to bounce it off your chest.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 4: Push the barbell back up</h2>
    <p>Exhale forcefully and push the barbell back up to the starting position, keeping your elbows close to your body. Make sure to fully extend your arms at the top of the movement.</p>
